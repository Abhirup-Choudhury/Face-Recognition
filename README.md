# Face-Recognition
This is my attempt in trying face recognition/verification using FaceNet and YOLO
I have fine tuned YOLO v8 for face detection. Check out this kaggle notebook for the finetuning using Ultralytics, and the model face_detection.pt which must be downloaded and stored in face_verification folder.
